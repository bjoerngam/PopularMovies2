# PopularMovies2
Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Project Number 2

In the second version of the popular movies app we had to improve the function of our app. 
So it should be possible to store the fav. movies into a local database and also we had to 
display some extra photos of the movie and showing the movie trailer.
